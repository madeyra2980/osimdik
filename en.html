            <h1 class="fade-in delay-2">Crop Production Today</h1>

            <p class="lang-section fade-in delay-3">
                The sown area of agricultural crops in the district is 54.4 thousand ha, including 18.9 thousand ha of grain crops. The sown area of oilseed crops is 19.9 thousand ha, which is 506 ha more than in 2018. Vegetable and melon crops and potatoes occupy 2.4 thousand ha, and fodder crops – 12.5 thousand ha, or 3.0 thousand ha more than in 2018.
                The enterprises "BA AgroGroup" and the farm "Lana" sowed 600 ha of winter wheat. 
                For seed renewal, agricultural entities in the district purchased 416.7 tons of elite seeds, including 325 tons of grain and 91.7 tons of oilseed crops.
                To improve crop yield quality, 67 tons of mineral fertilizers were purchased and used on over 6.0 thousand ha of crops.
                Over 118.4 million tenge of subsidies were allocated from the regional budget to support and develop crop production, including 54.8 million for elite seeds, 12.4 million for herbicides, and more than 51.1 million for investment reimbursement in the agro-industrial complex.
                For spring fieldwork and harvesting, 910 tons of subsidized diesel fuel were allocated and fully utilized by agricultural entities.
                Water-saving technologies and drip irrigation systems were introduced by district farms.
                The area cultivated using moisture-saving technologies by "BA AgroGroup", "Boztalym", and "Lana" reached more than 5.0 thousand ha. Irrigated land recovery using moisture-saving technologies is actively underway in farms like "Balke", "Lana-2", "Semey", "Stella", "Fontan", and the company "Beskaragai Agro".
                The total irrigated area was 3,053.2 ha, 530.2 ha more than in 2018, including 410.2 ha of drip irrigation, 131.5 ha of sprinkler irrigation, and 2,511.5 ha of ditch irrigation.
                Annual increases in the production of potatoes, vegetables, and melons are observed in Glukhovsky, Begensky, and Dolonsky rural districts. Out of 10 rural districts, 410.2 ha in Glukhovsky are irrigated using drip irrigation.
                Thanks to new technologies, demand for vegetables and melons is met in the cities of Semey, Ust-Kamenogorsk, and Pavlodar.
                Favorable autumn weather and 100% equipment readiness allowed timely and efficient harvests. This year, gross grain harvest was 133.0 thousand tons, oilseeds – 13.6 thousand tons, potatoes – 10.5 thousand tons, vegetables – 99.8 thousand tons, and melons – 77.0 thousand tons.
                Average yields were: grain – 9.0 q/ha, oilseeds – 7 q/ha, potatoes – 230 q/ha, vegetables and melons – 335 q/ha.
                For the 2019 harvest, 2.0 thousand ha of seeds were stored, with the plan 100% fulfilled.
                Additionally, 105 thousand tons of roughage, 4.0 thousand tons of haylage, 1 thousand tons of silage, and 12 thousand tons of straw were harvested, fulfilling 105% of the plan.
