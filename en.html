            <h1 class="fade-in delay-2">Crop Production Today</h1>

            <p class="lang-section fade-in delay-3">
                The sown area of agricultural crops in the district is 54.4 thousand ha, including 18.9 thousand ha of grain crops. The sown area of oilseed crops is 19.9 thousand ha, which is 506 ha more than in 2018. Vegetable and melon crops and potatoes occupy 2.4 thousand ha, and fodder crops – 12.5 thousand ha, or 3.0 thousand ha more than in 2018.

                To improve crop yield quality, 67 tons of mineral fertilizers were purchased and used on over 6.0 thousand ha of crops.
                Over 118.4 million tenge of subsidies were allocated from the regional budget to support and develop crop production, including 54.8 million for elite seeds, 12.4 million for herbicides, and more than 51.1 million for investment reimbursement in the agro-industrial complex.
                For spring fieldwork and harvesting, 910 tons of subsidized diesel fuel were allocated and fully utilized by agricultural entities.
                Water-saving technologies and drip irrigation systems were introduced by district farms.
                The area cultivated using moisture-saving technologies by "BA AgroGroup", "Boztalym", and "Lana" reached more than 5.0 thousand ha. Irrigated land recovery using moisture-saving technologies is actively underway in farms like "Balke", "Lana-2", "Semey", "Stella", "Fontan", and the company "Beskaragai Agro".

                Thanks to new technologies, demand for vegetables and melons is met in the cities of Semey, Ust-Kamenogorsk, and Pavlodar.
                Favorable autumn weather and 100% equipment readiness allowed timely and efficient harvests. This year, gross grain harvest was 133.0 thousand tons, oilseeds – 13.6 thousand tons, potatoes – 10.5 thousand tons, vegetables – 99.8 thousand tons, and melons – 77.0 thousand tons.
